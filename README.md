## 🚀 Overview

**Forex Predictor PRO** is a professional-grade quantitative trading tool. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and technical analysis to predict short-term price movements in Forex markets. 

By automating the complex analysis of historical data, technical indicators, and multi-timeframe trends, it provides traders with clear, actionable signals (**BUY**, **SELL**, or **FLAT**) alongside calculated risk management protocols.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent AI Engine
*   **XGBoost Classifier:** Utilizes Gradient Boosting to identify complex, non-linear patterns in market volatility and momentum.
*   **Hyperparameter Auto-Tuning:** Features built-in `RandomizedSearchCV` to automatically discover the absolute optimal mathematical configuration for any specific currency pair.
*   **Multi-Timeframe Confluence:** The engine cross-references the primary trading timeframe (e.g., 4H) against the macro trend (Daily timeframe) to aggressively filter out false breakouts ("fakeouts").

### 📊 Advanced Quantitative Pipeline
*   **Automated Data Ingestion:** Seamlessly fetches years of high-fidelity OHLCV data via the Yahoo Finance API.
*   **Extensive Feature Engineering:** Calculates over 20 unique technical data points per candle, including:
    *   *Momentum:* RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator
    *   *Trend:* Short & Long Moving Averages (SMA/EMA)
    *   *Volatility:* Bollinger Bands, Average True Range (ATR)
    *   *Price Action:* Candle body percentage, wick length, and volume analysis.

### 💻 Professional Trading Dashboard
*   **Live Interactive Charting:** Embedded real-time TradingView widget for simultaneous price action analysis.
*   **Premium Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, dark-mode aesthetic with live status indicators and dynamic probability gauges.
*   **Automated Risk Management:** Calculates dynamic **Stop Loss** and **Take Profit** levels based on current market volatility (ATR), enforcing strict risk discipline.

## 🛠️ Local Installation & Development

*(If you want to run the code locally on your own computer instead of using the live link above)*

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Your Strategy & API Key
Edit `config.yaml` to define your trading parameters. For reliable live data without rate limits, you must add a free API key:

1. **Get an API Key:** Sign up for a free account at [TwelveData.com](https://twelvedata.com/) and copy your API key.
2. **Update Config:** Paste it into `config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   twelvedata_api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   pair: "EURUSD=X"
   timeframe: "1h"
   confidence_threshold: 0.58
   ```

### 3. Initialize the AI (First Run)
Run the automated pipeline to download data, engineer features, and train the optimized model:
```bash
python src/retrain.py
```

### 4. Launch the Local Dashboard
Start the local web server to access the trading interface on your own machine:
```bash
python app.py
```
*Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.*

## 💡 How to Use the Signals

When a prediction is run, the model returns one of three outcomes:

*   🟢 **BUY:** The model detects a high-probability bullish setup. Look to enter a long position using the provided Stop Loss.
*   🔴 **SELL:** The model detects a high-probability bearish setup. Look to enter a short position.
*   🟡 **FLAT:** The market lacks a clear statistical edge or the confidence is below your threshold. Capital preservation is prioritized; do not trade.
